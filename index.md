Every summer, the Osborne-Nishimura lab does a summer workshop series, and it has grown every year! This summer we are focusing on different topics related to computer literacy and computing basics. 

This year's workshop is geared towards anyone interested in learning more about computers and computing and does not require prior computer science experience (though that never hurts). We encourgae people at all career stages (i.e. undergraduate, graduate, postdoc, PI) to attend and participate. 

We will introduce computer science concepts, give you a tour of computer hardware, learn more about different programming languages, and introduce GitHub as a way to collaborate. The overall goals are that both participants and presenters learn more about computing and computers along the way, to facilitate networking and collaboration among attendess, and encourage data sharing and reproducibility. 

We are very excited to host this year's computing workshop in person! The workshop will be held on **Wednesday, July 20th** from **1pm** to **3pm**. Join us in the [Molecular and Radiological Biosciences](https://goo.gl/maps/e9LsEpLVtt4xpX8Z7) (MRB) building at CSU in room 312. There will also be a  mixer afterward!

Following the workshop, we will send out a short survey to get your feedback so please keep an eye on your inbox! 
Also, see below under **Resources** for some additional training opertunities and educational resources. 

## Sign up form

Planning to attend? Then please complete this [SIGN UP FORM](https://colostate.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6SbbpwjucRLzQJU) to register. 

Please register by July 15th if possible so that we can get an idea of attendance. If you happen to register later than that, that is also ok. 

## Speakers, Topics, and Schedule 

Participants do not need to install or prepare anything ahead of the workshop. **Bring a laptop to the workshop if you have one, but they are not required.**

### Naly Torres - Host

Naly will introduce the speakers and provide personality.

### Jessica Hill - Intro Computing Systems and Hardware (1 - 1:30 pm)

Jessica will present an overview of computing systems, including the different types of systems, how to interact with them, and how they can be utilized for research.

### Robert Williams - Working on GitHub (2:30 - 3 pm)

Rob will introduce GitHub as a tool and resource for researchers, how to manage data and projects on GitHub, and how to share and facilitate collaborations through GitHub. He will also discuss how GitHub can help researchers track and reproduce their data.
