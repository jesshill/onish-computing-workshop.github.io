# Welcome to the Onish Summer Computing Workshop 2022!

Every summer, the Osborne-Nishimura lab does a summer workshop series, and it has grown every year! This summer we are focusing on different topics related to computer literacy and computing basics. 

We are excited to host this years computing workshop in person! The workshop will be held on **Wednesday, July 20th** from **1pm** to **3pm**. There will be a mixer afterward!
