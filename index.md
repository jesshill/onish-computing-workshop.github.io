# Welcome to the Onish Summer Computing Workshop 2022!

Every summer, the Osborne-Nishimura lab does a summer workshop series, and it has grown every year! This summer we are focusing on different topics related to computer literacy and computing basics. 

This years workshop is geared towards anyone interested in learning more about computers and computing and does not require prior computer science experience (though that never hurts). We encourgae people at all career stages (i.e. undergraduate, graduate, postdoc, PI) to attend and participate. 

We will introduce computer science concepts, give you a tour of computer hardware, learn more about different programming languages, and introduce GitHub as a way to collaborate. The overall goals being that both participants and presenters learn more about computing and computers along the way, to facilitate networking and collaboration among attendess, and encourage data sharing and reproducibility. 

We are very excited to host this years computing workshop in person! The workshop will be held on **Wednesday, July 20th** from **1pm** to **3pm**. Join us in the [Molecular and Radiological Biosciences](https://goo.gl/maps/e9LsEpLVtt4xpX8Z7) (MRB) building at CSU in room 312. There will also be a  mixer afterward!

Following the workshop, we will send out a short survey to get your feedback so please keep an eye on your inbox! 

## Sign up form

## Speakers, Topics, and Schedule 

Currently, participants do not need to install or prepare anything ahead of the workshop. Though this may change, so please check back closer to the workshop date to find any updates. 

### Naly Torres - Host

Naly will introduce the speakers and provide personality.

### Jessica Hill - Computing Systems (1 - 1:30 pm)

Jessica will present an overview of computing systems, including the different types of systems, how to interact with them, and how they can be utilized for research. 

### Andrew Moore - Programming Languages and Their Usages (1:30 - 2 pm)

Andrew will present an overview of various types of programming languages and their usages, with an emphasis on how different languages can be applied to different research questions and problems. 

### David King - ... (2 - 2:30 pm)

David will present on software instillation, dealing with software dependencies during instillation, and how to establish project environments with Conda. 

### Robert Williams - Working on GitHub (2:30 - 3 pm)

Rob will introduce GitHub as a tool and resource for researchers, how to manage data and projects on GitHub, and how to share and facilitate collaborations through GitHub. He will also discuss how GitHub can help researches track and reproduce their data.

## Mixer 

Following the workshop, join us for a light mixer. Stay to meet other researchers across campus with similar interests or hang out and ask more questions.
